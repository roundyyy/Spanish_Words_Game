AUDIO FILES NEEDED:

Place the following MP3 files in this assets directory:

1. click.mp3 - A short click sound (< 0.5 seconds) that plays when selecting words
2. complete.mp3 - A completion sound that plays when finishing a round of word matching

Make sure these are actual MP3 audio files, not text files.
The app will handle them gracefully if they're missing (no sounds will play).
